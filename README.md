# amico

Relationships (e.g. friendships) backed by Redis.

## Installation

`gem install amico`

or in your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'amico'
```

Make sure your redis server is running! Redis configuration is outside the scope of this README, but 
check out the Redis documentation, http://redis.io/documentation.
  
## Usage

Configure amico:

```ruby
Amico.configure do |configuration|
  configuration.redis = Redis.new
  configuration.namespace = 'amico'
  configuration.following_key = 'following'
  configuration.followers_key = 'followers'
  configuration.page_size = 25
end
```

Use amico:

```ruby
require 'amico'
 => true 

Amico.configure do |configuration|
  configuration.redis = Redis.new
  configuration.namespace = 'amico'
  configuration.following_key = 'following'
  configuration.followers_key = 'followers'
  configuration.page_size = 25
end

Amico.follow(1, 11)
=> [1, 1] 

Amico.following?(1, 11)
 => true 

Amico.following?(11, 1)
 => false 

Amico.follow(11, 1)
 => [1, 1] 

Amico.following?(11, 1)
 => true 

Amico.following_count(1)
 => 1 

Amico.followers_count(1)
 => 1 

Amico.unfollow(11, 1)
 => [1, 1] 

Amico.following_count(11)
 => 0 

Amico.following_count(1)
 => 1 

Amico.follower?(1, 11)
 => false

Amico.following(1)
 => ["11"]
```

You can pass `:page => 1` and `:page_size => 25` options into the `following` and `followers` methods. Set the values as appropriate.

* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
